# Autonomous-agent-with-intelligence

Code written for the class "programming in C/C++" in Tilburg university.

When run, the agent is capable of navigating through the maze. I achieved this goal to a large extent, successfully implementing a maze solver with DepthFirst Search (DFS) algorithm.The program not only finds a path through the maze but also interacts dynamically with different elements within the maze, such as boosters and hurdles, adjusting its properties accordingly.
